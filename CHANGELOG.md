## v1.0.0 (2022-12-18)

### Breaking

* feat: limit calls to get_light_level to once per 10 minutes

Refactored most of the code to simplify the interface and to
reduce the amount of unnecessary processing required by the
consumer.

BREAKING CHANGE: class names have changed as follows:

  Connect =&gt; SomaConnect
  Shade   =&gt; SomaShade

The values returned by the SomaShade methods have beenn simplified
to return either a boolean to denote whether the action succeeded
or not or the value of the requested property.
